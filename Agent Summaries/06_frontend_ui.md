# Agent Summary — 06 Frontend UI

- Implemented the minimal one-page UI per PRD §8.
- Components:
  - `client/src/components/ImmunoSection.tsx`: input block for a single immuno with slides, up to 3 primaries, and color per primary. Includes debounced autocomplete via `/api/suggest/targets?q=` and a simple dropdown (keyboard navigable).
  - `client/src/components/Tables.tsx`: renders Primaries, Secondaries, and Solutions tables matching PRD §6.2.
  - `client/src/App.tsx`: orchestrates app state, validates inputs, submits to `/api/plan`, shows warnings, and renders tables.
- Theme: extended `client/src/theme.css` with subtle grid background, cards, semantic tables, and responsive grid for inputs.
- Accessibility: labeled inputs, roles on combobox/listbox with keyboard navigation, buttons have aria-labels, warnings use `role="status"`.
- Debugging: `console.warn` on invalid form submission, suggest fetch failures, and plan submission errors.
- File sizes kept under ~300 lines per file.

Acceptance checks:
- App loads and UI interactions work without API (autocomplete shows when available).
- Build passes via `npm run build`.

Notes:
- The autocomplete gracefully degrades if API is unavailable.
- Tables expect the server shapes from `/api/plan` per PRD §7.
