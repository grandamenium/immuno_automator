# Agent Summary â€” 07 Frontend integration + niceties

- Wired UI to `POST /api/plan` and transformed server response into UI-friendly shapes for the three tables.
- Fixed autocomplete to read `{ suggestions }` from `GET /api/suggest/targets`.
- Added CSV export buttons for Primaries, Secondaries, and Solutions (manual CSV generation via Blob + download link).
- Persisted last form input in `localStorage` and restored on load with basic validation.
- Added simple debug logs and a lightweight toast for success/error messages.
- Verified build with `npm run build`.

Acceptance checks:
- A successful request renders the three tables accurately.
- CSV export works for each table with expected headers.
- Refresh restores previous form state.
