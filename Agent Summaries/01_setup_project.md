# Agent Summary â€” 01 Setup project structure and tooling

Scope: Initialize project skeleton per PRD with minimal dependencies, scripts, and placeholders. No business logic implemented.

Files added/edited:
- `package.json` with scripts and deps (moved `better-sqlite3` to optional)
- `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`
- `server/index.js`, `server/dev.js`, `server/import_excel.js`, `server/logic.js`, `server/db.js`, `server/types.d.ts`
- `client/index.html`, `client/src/main.tsx`, `client/src/App.tsx`, `client/src/components/.gitkeep`, `client/src/theme.css`
- `sqlite/.gitkeep`, `data/.gitkeep`

Commands executed:
- `npm install --no-fund --no-audit`
- `npm run build`
- Started server and verified `/health` 200 JSON

Debugging notes:
- Node 24 caused `better-sqlite3` native build errors; set as optional dependency to unblock install. Will revisit when DB layer is implemented (pin Node 20 or use prebuilt binaries).
- Server logs startup and `/health` requests; dev runner captures uncaught errors.

Next steps:
- Implement Excel ingestion and SQLite schema (step 02) and add unit tests for logic in later steps.
